## ‚≠ê Overview

Discover, plan, and book your next adventure with ease using the Travel Booking Website, a comprehensive platform designed to simplify your travel experience.

> #### The Problem
> Planning a trip often involves navigating disparate websites, comparing countless options, and managing bookings across various platforms. This fragmented approach can lead to confusion, inefficiency, and missed opportunities, detracting from the excitement of travel itself.

> #### The Solution
> The Travel Booking Website provides an elegant, centralized solution, offering a user-friendly interface to browse an extensive catalog of tours, manage bookings, and personalize your travel itinerary from a single, intuitive platform. It streamlines the entire process, allowing users to focus on the joy of exploration.

This project is a robust, full-stack web application built following a client-server architecture. The `frontend` is a dynamic and responsive Single Page Application (SPA) developed with React.js, providing an engaging user experience. The `Backend` is a powerful RESTful API service crafted with Node.js and the Express.js framework, handling all business logic, data persistence, and authentication. Data is stored efficiently in a MongoDB database, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Travel Booking Website on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

*   **Node.js**: v14.x or higher (LTS recommended).
*   **npm**: Node Package Manager (comes with Node.js).
*   **MongoDB**: An instance of MongoDB (local or cloud-based).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/darshan102030/Travel-web-f0c2096.git
    cd darshan102030-Travel-web-f0c2096
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    Navigate into the `Backend` directory and install dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd Backend
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `Backend` directory with your environment variables.
    ```
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.abcde.mongodb.net/tour-booking?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
    JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key"
    ```
    *Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `cluster0.abcde` with your MongoDB Atlas credentials or local MongoDB URI.*

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    Navigate into the `frontend` directory and install dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```
    The frontend configuration uses `config.js` in `src/utils`. Ensure the `BASE_URL` matches your backend's port.
    ```javascript
    // frontend/src/utils/config.js
    export const BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:5000/api/v1'; // Adjust if your backend runs on a different port
    ```

## üîß Usage

Once both the backend and frontend dependencies are installed and configured, you can start the application.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    From the `Backend` directory:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or for production mode
    # npm start
    ```
    The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000` (or the PORT specified in your `.env` file).

2.  **Start the Frontend Application:**
    From the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

After both are running:
*   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
*   You can now browse tours, register a new account, log in, search for specific tours, view tour details, and proceed with booking.
*   Explore the `AdminTour` page (if implemented with an admin user) for tour management functionalities.
